        <td><p>Glen Henry is a father changing the world. With prior success in music, he left the industry because he realized the biggest “stage” he’d ever perform on would be in his living room and his biggest fans would be his family. In 2015, he started his fast-growing YouTube channel called Beleaf In Fatherhood by welcoming us into his home to show the fun and real misadventures of parenting.  Glen Henry is a father changing the world. With prior success in music, he left the industry because he realized the biggest “stage” he’d ever perform on would be in his living room and his biggest fans would be his family. In 2015, he started his fast-growing YouTube channel called Beleaf In Fatherhood by welcoming us into his home to show the fun and real misadventures of parenting. Growing up in Baltimore, he saw few examples of healthy family dynamics. Now he hopes to Equip Fathers, Give Hope to Mothers and Inspire Children with every upload. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.</p></td>
